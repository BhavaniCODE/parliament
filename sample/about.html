              The course on Indian Parliamentary democracy attempts to trace the theoretical 
              and practical linkages between the Constitution of India, the Parliament, 
              the Judiciary and the civil society. Democracy is known as the system of checks 
              and balance. While analyzing the synergies between the Legislature, the Judiciary 
              and the Civil Society, the course will also highlight the points of divergence and 
              constant tension, which involves the interpretation of Constitutional provisions. 
              The four institutions mentioned above are not viewed as independent but interdependent 
              entities, which have to function synergistically for a constitutional republic to be 
              successful.  
            </p>
            <p>Compared to the British and the American systems of government, Indian democracy 
              has charted a middle path between the two. The British Parliament is supreme and the judiciary
               cannot overrule the laws ratified by the Parliament. While the American judiciary has the 
               final say in interpreting the American Constitution despite Article 1, mentioning the Congress 
               followed by Article 2, the Presidency and Article 3, the Judiciary. The separation of powers is 
               paramount in the American system of government as the founders envisaged a republican form of 
               government vis-a-vis a monarchy. The American Bill of Rights guarantees fundamental rights of the 
               people with the due process providing access to Constitutional remedies in the form of judicial review, which is binding on the both the Executive and the 
              Legislature. Individual rights are strongly protected in the American system. </p>
              <p>In India, the judiciary often strikes a fine balance between the fundamental 
                rights of the people, the power of the legislature to amend the Constitution and the 
                authority of the executive. The Constitution of India while ensuring due process and 
                judicial review also qualifies the fundamental rights. The reasonable restrictions enabled 
                the executive and the legislature to carry out the social, political and economic revolution 
                to transform the lives of all Indians, a major objective of the leaders of the freedom struggle 
                against the British rule. There have been instances of executive, legislative and judicial 
                overreach. But immediately there has always been a course correction as the government, 
                legislators and the judges 
                realize the separation of powers and their Constitutionally well-defined roles. </p>
            <p>Democracy without civil society and media is unimaginable. 
              The role played by the civil society and media cannot be gainsaid in a democracy though newer 
              forms of media bring in its wake, advantages and challenges. The pivotal contributions of 
              civil society and media, traditionally known as pillars of democracy when they perform their 
              functions with integrity and good will are also discussed in detail. </p>
